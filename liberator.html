<h1>AR-23 Liberator</h1>

<h2>Ingame Description</h2>
<p>The SEAF standard assault rifle, balancing power, fire rate, and weight for a reliable weapon against smaller targets.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The AR-23 Liberator is a balanced all-round weapon. It can take out medium enemies by hitting them in the weak spot, and is surprisingly good against devestators. It burns through ammo quickly, and isn't the best option for crowd clear; for that, a shotgun is recommended.</p>

<h1>P-4 Senator</h1>
<p>A high-damage revolver, which can be reloaded with single rounds. A heavy-hitting and reliable sidearm.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
The Senator is a heavy-hitting sidearm and can reliably one-shot all devestators, provided you can hit them in the faceplate. In practice, that's easier said than done, especially once you get into a problematic stagger cycle. Still, for stealth gameplay, or when you have decent cover or aren't the primary target, the six-round revolver can't be beat. Empty reloads do use a speed loader - which loads all six rounds at once - so it can often be faster to fire off the remaining round or two before reloading, albeit at the cost of extra ammo.
